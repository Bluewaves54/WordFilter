Program to filter words in the English dictionary based on restrictions.

Input restrictions as python boolean expressions using `word` and press `Enter`. For example:

  ```len(word) > 5```

  ```'r' in word```

  ```word[-2:-1] != 'ed'```

  ```word[0] == 'l'```


After your last command, type `finish`, press `Enter`, and then wait for the words to print. Enjoy!
